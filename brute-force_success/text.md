## Explanation: 

EventCode 4624 indicates that a successful log-in has occured. As seen in the **brute-force attack** folder and in the **splunk_brute_force_4625** 
image, the brute-force attack occured around Sunday, Oct 26 at 10:14 PM to 10:16 PM and if we look at the image within this folder, **splunk_brute_force_4624**,
one instance of 4624 occured. This means that the brute-force attack was successful and the account has been breached, and SOC analysts must go through triage,
containment, eradication, and recovery.
