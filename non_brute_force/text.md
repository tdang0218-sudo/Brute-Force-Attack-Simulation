## Explanation
**hydra_non-brute-force_attack(1)** and **hydra_non-brute-force_attack(2)** shows what the command I used to simulate a non-brute-force attack looks like.
**splunk_non-brute-force_4625** shows the timeline and number of login attempts on Splunk. We can see that a non-brute-force attack is much more spaced out
in terms of timeline and the number of login attempt is much lower if compared to an actual brute-force attack.
