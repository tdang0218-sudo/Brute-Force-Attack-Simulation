## Explanation:

The image displays a list of 20 weak passwords I created for Hydra to use during a simulated brute-force attack. These passwords are 
intentionally simple and commonly used in real-world attacks, making them ideal for testing purposes. To mimic typical brute-force 
scenarios, I generated 20 similarly weak passwords, with the 20th one being my Windows' VM actual password (which has been redacted in the photo).
