This image provides the raw event in Splunk, specifically for the 4625 EventCode. Raw events are important because they provide unaltered data 
that SOC analysts use during validation and investigation. Raw events includes timestamps, IP addresses (changed in photo), usernames (changed in photo), processes, and
event details which SOC analysts use to address a brute-force attack incident. Raw events are the real evidence behind dashboards and timecharts, ensuring 
SOC analysts' conclusions are based on authentic data.
