## Explanation
**hydra_brute-force_attack** and **hydra_brute-force_attack_success** shows the command used to simulate a brute-force attack and what it looks like when the command
successfully finds the correct password. **splunk_brute_force_4625** shows the timeline and number of attempts of a brute-force attack in Splunk. We can see that 23 attempts
happens all around the same time. This is a clear indication that a brute-force attack is happening and as a SOC analyst, we should investigate the affected account.
