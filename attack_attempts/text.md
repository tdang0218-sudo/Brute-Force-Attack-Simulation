## Explanation: 

As a SOC analyst you care about attempt rates because it helps you identify whether or not a brute-force is happening.
Attempt rates shows how frequently a failed log in attempt occured over time which can indicate a targeted or automated attack. 
By knowing the attempt rates, SOC analysts can accordingly identify and respond to the brute-force attacks. In the image I showed the
SPL I used to find the number of times a failed log-in occured (count) and target of the attack (Account_Name).
