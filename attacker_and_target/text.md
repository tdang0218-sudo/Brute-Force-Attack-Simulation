## Explanation:

The SPL used in the image shows how to identify the attacker and target in Splunk. By knowing the attacker and target, SOC analysts are able 
to identify the intent, attack path, and severity of a brute-force attack. In my simulation, **Workstation_Name** was used to identify the attacker, while **Account_Name**
was used to identify the target.
