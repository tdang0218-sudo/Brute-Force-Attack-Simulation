**Explanation:**
During the investigation phase of a SOC analyst, there could be a multitude of logs for one workstation in Splunk, and maybe you want to look 
for certain logs from 2 days ago or maybe even a week ago. That is why it is important to know how to efficiently look for logs you want, specifically 
the time frame of it.

In the image, I highlight how to specify a time frame, so that a SOC analyst can efficiently go through the investigation phase without looking through
unnecessary logs.
